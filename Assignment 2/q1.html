                	<p>My favorite place to travel to so far is Duluth. There is so much to do there, my favorite places here are Enger tower, Gooseberry, Great Lakes Aquarium, Hawk Ridge, Park Point, and Split Rock. </p>

                	<h4>Image of Enger Tower</h4>
                	<p>
						Enger tower is one beutiful place. It has a American-Japanese style park at the base of the tower. 
						The park features a Peace bell that was donated from the sister city of Ohara-Isumi.
						At the top of the tower you get one of the best views of duluth, you can see the following locations from here, Great Lakes Aquarium, Park Point, Lester river, 
						the aerial lift bridge and much more.

                	<h4>Image of Gooseberry falls</h4>
                	<p>
						This is gooseberry falls. This one is in twin harbors so it is a little drive north from duluth. This location is worth the drive.
						Whether it is summer or winter you are sure to get some spectatular sights. If you go in the summer, you can also swim there too, however the water is
						just as cold as lake superior so even in summer it is a chilly dip. In the winter, you obviously don't get to swim but sometimes the waterfall will freeze
						over and you will get this beutiful sight of a waterfall frozen in time.

                	<h4>Image of Great Lakes Aquarium</h4>
                	<p>
						A fun place to visit at least once is the Great Lakes Aquarium. This is a place that I have visited multiple times growing up. While it has some fun
						This aquarium houses all sorts of animals from the Great Lakes, the aquarium also lets you pet the stingrays. They are also known for their
						informational exhibits too, they have on interactive one where you can take a toy ship through the multiple locks of the great lakes.

                	<h4>Image of Hawk Ridge</h4>
                	<p>
						Hawk Ridge is a recent place that I have visited. This is another spot that is great for the views. Along the way up there you were able to get multiple
						views of lakes superior and the bay, which were just stunning. When you get to the top you will reach an observation platform where you can look for birds.
						The birds that you can see are listed nearby by season so you can plan another visit during a time you want to see a certain bird.

                	<h4>Image of Park point</h4>
                	<p>
						Park Point is my favorite place to go swimming in duluth. This place is the sand bar that strechs in front of the bay of duluth. The lake is pretty cold
						however so swimming in it is not for the feignt of heart. If you do want to go swimming there best time to do so would be end of august beginning of september.

                	<h4>Image of Split Rock</h4>
                	<p>
						Split rock is another place that isn't in duluth, it is in twin harbors. This place however is another fun place to go on a trip to duluth
						You can get a tour of the place which will go into the story of why the lighthouse was erected. One of those facts is that this point on lake superior
						is one of the most dangerous. there are multiple areas where rocks shoot up and can ruin a ship. In fact you might even be able to see one off the coast.

                	<h4>Image of Kyoto, Japan</h4>
                	<p>
						Finally since I am not well traveled, one place I would like to go to is Japan. Since taking japanese in highschool, I have been addicted to learning
						more about the language and culture. If I went there I would definitely want to visit some of the famos places for sure like akihabara for the shopping,
						Nara for the deer, Kyoto for the temples.
